# Admin API Routes - Mock Mode Fix

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

The Role Management page was showing HTTP 500 errors because the admin API routes were still trying to connect to real Supabase instead of using mock data.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. Updated `/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

- ✅ Added mock mode detection
- ✅ Returns mock user data with proper roles
- ✅ Supports user role updates in mock mode
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with real Supabase

### 2. Updated `/app/api/admin/get-admin-users/route.ts`

- ✅ Added mock mode detection
- ✅ Returns mock admin user IDs
- ✅ Works for both authenticated and internal calls

### 3. Mock Data Structure Verified

- ✅ **5 test users** (1 admin, 1 publisher, 3 regular)
- ✅ **3 approved profiles** (will show in Role Management)
- ✅ **1 pending, 1 rejected** profile
- ✅ Proper role metadata in fixtures

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After the fix, the Role Management page should show:

| Metric            | Value                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Total Users**   | 3 (approved profiles)  |
| **Admins**        | 1 (admin@test.com)     |
| **Publishers**    | 1 (publisher@test.com) |
| **Regular Users** | 1 (user@test.com)      |

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### 1. Enable Mock Mode

```bash
# In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Sign In as Admin

- **Email**: `admin@test.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`

### 4. Navigate to Role Management

- Go to Admin Panel → Role Management
- Should see user counts (no more HTTP 500 errors)
- Should see list of approved users

### 5. Test Role Updates

- Try changing user roles
- Changes should persist during session
- Data resets on page reload (by design)

## 🔍 **Verification**

Look for these indicators that it's working:

✅ **Orange mock mode banner** at top of page  
✅ **No HTTP 500 errors** in Role Management  
✅ **User counts display correctly**  
✅ **User list shows approved profiles**  
✅ **Role changes work** (publisher/admin toggles)  
✅ **Console logs** show `[Mock API]` messages

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### If still getting HTTP 500 errors:

1. **Check environment variable**:

   ```bash
   # Verify in browser console
   console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA)
   # Should show "true"
   ```

2. **Check mock mode banner**:

   - Orange banner should be visible
   - If not visible, mock mode isn't active

3. **Clear browser cache**:

   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Clear browser storage

4. **Check console for errors**:
   - Look for API call failures
   - Check for missing mock data

### If user counts are wrong:

1. **Reset mock data**:

   - Use "Reset Data" button in orange banner
   - Or refresh the page (data resets automatically)

2. **Check profile statuses**:
   - Only "approved" profiles count toward user totals
   - Pending/rejected users are excluded

## 📝 **API Routes Status**

| Route                               | Status     | Mock Mode Support                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/api/admin/users`                  | ✅ Fixed   | Full support                     |
| `/api/admin/get-admin-users`        | ✅ Fixed   | Full support                     |
| `/api/admin/create-family-accounts` | ⚠️ Partial | Not critical for Role Management |
| `/api/admin/family-member-requests` | ⚠️ Unknown | May need future updates          |

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the Role Management page** - should work now!
2. **Test other admin features** - may need similar fixes
3. **Report any remaining issues** - additional API routes may need updates

**✨ The Role Management page should now work perfectly in mock mode!**
